# RestaurantManagementSystem
In general the restaurant owner manages a couple of tables and you need to support online reservation.
A table has the following properties: location (let it be free text) and number of sits

The main screen should display a list of tables and support filtering by size and by reservations for a given period.

It will be nice to have a reservation entry form as well. Reservation is just picking a table and time.
